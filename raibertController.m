%RAIBERTCONTROLLER Simple Raibert controller for SLIP monoped
%   This controller is called at lift off (entering flight phase)
%   in order to adjust the leg touchdown angle to maintain
%   the desired forward velocity

    % This is the feedback gain for ft displacement from neutral point
    % measured in m/(m/s), which is just s
    k = 0.05;

        % Find the foot placement
        heightOfMatrix = size(q);
        stance_amt = heightOfMatrix(1) - 1; % How much is actually in stance
        Ts = t(stance_amt) - t(1); % Duration of stance phase
        CG_print = fwrd_vel * Ts; % length of CG print
        xf0 = CG_print / 2; % Neutral point of the CG print
        xfdelta = k * (fwrd_vel - s.d_fwrd_vel); % displacement of ft from neutral point
        xf = xf0 + xfdelta; % where to place the foot
        
        % Find the touchdown angle

    % anything (for this SLIP model at least)
